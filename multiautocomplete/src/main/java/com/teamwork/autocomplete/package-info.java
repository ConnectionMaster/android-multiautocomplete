/**
 * MultiAutoComplete is a library that provides a layer of abstraction over the Android {@link android.widget.MultiAutoCompleteTextView}
 * standard component, to simplify showing a drop down menu with suggestions for auto complete when a user is typing into the edit text.
 * <p>
 * It supports different data sets and layouts on the same view, and allows full customization of the adapter layout appearance and the way
 * the data is filtered.
 * <p>
 * See the README on GitHub for the full documentation.
